        <p>The Sundarbans is a vast forest on the coast of the Bay of Bengal, one of the natural wonders of the world.
            Located in the delta of the Padma , Meghna and Brahmaputra basins , this magnificent forest covers Khulna ,
            Satkhira , Bagerhat , Patuakhali and Barguna districts of Bangladesh and two districts of the Indian state
            of West Bengal covering North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas . [2] The largest of the coastal saline
            environment As a mangrove forest, the Sundarbans is the largest intact forest in the world. [3] The
            Sundarbans covers an area of ​​10,000 sq km, of which 6,016 sq km (72%) [4] is in Bangladesh [5] and the
            rest (36%) is in India.

            The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site on December 6, 1997 . [6] Although Bangladesh and
            India are in fact adjacent parts of the same uninterrupted territory, they have been inscribed on the UNESCO
            World Heritage List under different names; Named 'Sundarbans' and ' Sundarbans National Park ' respectively.
            Despite this protection, the Indian Sundarbans was considered endangered in the 2020 assessment under the
            IUCN Red List of Ecosystem Framework. [7] The Sundarbans is entangled in a network of small archipelagos
            with marine currents, mud chars, and salinity of mangrove forests. 31.1 per cent of the total forest area,
            i.e. 1,84 sq km, is covered by rivers, creeks and beels. [4]In addition to the famous Royal Bengal Tiger ,
            the forest is known to be home to a wide variety of birds, chitra deer , crocodiles and snakes .</p><br>
